### Android tweaks ###

"Talkback lite" -- swipe down to read text on screen, a la "speak screen" on iOS 8+

### Emacs/emacspeak tweaks ###

1) Start with speech rate = 400. Right now, I manually do C-u C-e d r 400. I tried editing the speech rate in the lisp file, but it's not picking it up for some reason

*DONE* 2) Start with window maximized, but not in full screen mode. I was able to get the height right, but the width is too lond and I can't figure out how to change this.

*DONE* 3) Start with font at ~40 point. I figured out how to change the background to black and the color to white, but haven't figured out the fond. Also, would love to change the font to "fixed width".

4) gnus: gmail tweaks so that it mirrors gmail web interface -- start with Inbox opened, conversation view, sort so top message is most recent, bold unread messages, have only headers: date, from, subject, message size, replied/forwarded flag in that order.

sampele line in message view:

17-Feb James M(22) Subjectis A4
Date/From(with convo count)/Subject/AttachmentFlag/PriorityInboxGlag
Characters:6+1 + 7+4+1 + 9+1 +2

Want to mirror gmail: most recent at top, start with inbox folder open

5) Set up gmail offline, so I have a copy of messages in my inbox locally

6) Set up google calendar with org-mode (or use calfw -- can't figure out how to install properly)
-Create custom lists of events based on tags (or words in event name). For example: Travel tag:

Jan 20 2016 BOS - RDU
Mar 20 2016 RDU - SEA
Jun 20 2016 BOS - AKL

or Birthdays tag:

Jan 20 2016 John Smith
Mar 20 2016 Jack Black
Jun 20 2016 George Mason
