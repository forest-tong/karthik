Do you just want to convert other time zones to your time zone, or the other way around as well?
What about arbitrary times?
Do you prefer 12-hour or 24-hour time?
Do you want the places/times to be highlighted?
What aspects of weather do you want to know?
Do you need the font to be changed in the command?
